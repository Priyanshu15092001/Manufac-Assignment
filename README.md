# Agro Data Analysis Dashboard üåæ

This project is built using the **Vite** + **Mantine v7** template and is designed to analyze agricultural data from 1950 to 2020. It processes a JSON dataset to provide insights into crop production, average yield, and cultivation areas, displaying the results in a modern and interactive web interface.

---

## **Features**

### üîç Max/Min Crop Production by Year
- Displays the crops with the highest and lowest production for each year.

### üìä Average Yield and Cultivation Area by Crop
- Calculates and displays the average yield (in Kg/Ha) and cultivation area (in Ha) for each crop.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Framework**: [Mantine v7](https://mantine.dev/)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Mantine components, CSS
- **Data Handling**: JSON dataset
- **Package Manager**: Yarn

# Agro Data Analysis Dashboard üåæ

This project is a **React.js + TypeScript** application for analyzing agricultural data from 1950 to 2020. It provides insights into crop production, average yield, and cultivation areas, with features like:

1. **Max/Min Crop Production by Year**: Displays crops with maximum and minimum production for each year.
2. **Average Yield and Cultivation Area by Crop**: Shows average yield and cultivation area of each crop between 1950-2020.

---

## **Features**

### üîç Max/Min Crop Production by Year
- Displays the crops with the highest and lowest production for each year.
- Handles ties by listing multiple crops with the same values, separated by commas.
- Treats empty production data as `0`.

### üìä Average Yield and Cultivation Area by Crop
- Calculates and displays the average yield (in Kg/Ha) and cultivation area (in Ha) for each crop.
